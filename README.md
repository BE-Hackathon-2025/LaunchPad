# LaunchPad

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯

**How might we bridge the gap between education and employability for students in underrepresented communities through personalized, AI-powered career guidance?**
**How might we help computer science students gain clarity on the specific skills, certifications, and experiences needed to reach their desired tech careers?**

## Project Description 🤯

LaunchPad is an AI-powered career acceleration platform that generates personalized roadmaps to guide students and professionals from learning to landing a job. Users complete a short onboarding process or upload their resume, and LaunchPad’s AI builds a detailed, role-specific roadmap that includes courses, projects, certifications, and real-world opportunities. The platform features a Career Copilot chatbot, Interview Studio for mock interviews with AI feedback, and Opportunities matching with “fit scores” based on user skills. Each user’s progress is tracked in a dynamic portfolio that showcases readiness and verified achievements.

## Project Value 💰

LaunchPad empowers students, especially from under-resourced or underrepresented backgrounds, to pursue tech careers with structure and confidence. For students, it translates vague ambitions into step-by-step career plans aligned with their coursework and internships. For professionals, it recommends certifications, advanced projects, and upskilling paths for career advancement. Schools and sponsors benefit from a scalable, data-driven platform that improves job readiness and connects diverse talent pipelines to industry partners.
